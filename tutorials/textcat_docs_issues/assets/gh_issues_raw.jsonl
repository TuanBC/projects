{"text":"# Blender Addon for importing OpenMVG SfM reconstruction results\n\nHi Pierre,\r\n\r\nI am working on a Blender Addon (https://github.com/SBCV/Blender-Addon-Photogrammetry-Importer) that allows you to import different photogrammetry data formats into Blender. The latest version supports now OpenMVG JSON files.\r\n\r\nI can imagine that this tool could be useful for other OpenMVG JSON files users as well. It offers for example a nice way to visualize the reconstruction results (including cameras and image planes).\r\n\r\nOne can use Blender's camera animation tool to render the reconstruction. The camera animation in Blender offers many useful options to define the camera motion. You can define for example the camera path in 3D and add looking constraints for the camera.\r\nFurthermore, you can load different models (with different file formats) into Blender at the same time. So you can for example render a point cloud and the corresponding mesh at the same time (e.g. to highlight differences).\r\nI used it for example to compare reconstruction results of virtual data with the corresponding virtual environment.\r\n\r\nFor Blender users:\r\nYou can use OpenMVG instead of Blender's camera tracking tool to reconstruct the scene. Which is way more comfortable, since Blender's camera tracking requires a lot of user interaction to compute reasonable results.\r\n\r\nJust wanted to inform you about that. Maybe you want to add a reference to the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to close this issue.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nSebastian","html":"<h1>Blender Addon for importing OpenMVG SfM reconstruction results</h1>\n\n<p>Hi Pierre,</p>\n\n<p>I am working on a Blender Addon (https://github.com/SBCV/Blender-Addon-Photogrammetry-Importer) that allows you to import different photogrammetry data formats into Blender.

Please describe.**\r\nQuite often, I need to add snippets of minified code from third parties for things like analytics, error reporting, etc. It's quite annoying having this minified, obfuscated rubbish clutter up 384 lines when I'm never going to have to do anything with it\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWhat I'd like to do is have a special piece of text that could be put in a comment to prevent formatting in that region.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI've thought about putting these minified code sections into a separate file, but I think that isn't great. Sometimes, splitting up sections of code from each other is a good idea but often these small pieces of code are designed to be loaded ASAP. In HTML, by being delivered with the rest of the page, it cuts down on requests back to the server which takes extra time and resources in a browser.

{"text":"# Change how default config values are handed in the code\n\nThe most common way to handle default values for config options seems to be to attempt to look up the key in the toml, then assign a default value if that fails, something like `config.get_as_type(key).unwrap_or(default_value)`.

Lakka site does not list what emulator cores are available, where is PS2 emulation core at? The latest Retroarch has it included.\r\n\r\n6.I wanted to delete a entry from a game rom that was on a different drive. But now I'm stuck with a double of the listed game rom.\r\n\r\n7. Screenshots show 0% when taking one through the menu but they actually are taken despite never showing 100%\r\n\r\n8.PPSSPP sometimes when I load a save state it crashes the core. save state loading might start from 75% to 85%  when it does happen. \r\n\r\nSo far I have found Lakka OS to be frustrating  and I doubt this is all the issues I will find so far with version  Lakka-Generic x86_64-2.2.2\r\n\r\nI don't want to install retroarch on Linux Mint because i find it a waste of resources with all the other OS programs/resources running will take away from game emulation. Which is why I like the idea of something like Lakka OS","meta":{"source":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/libretro/Lakka-LibreELEC/issues/745"}}

This issue is just to document the major improvements that are contained in this release. In order of the tools, these include:\r\n\r\n- BRAT Project Builder: Incorporating beaver dams and land ownership in BRAT folder structure and adding layers.\r\n- BRAT Table: Adding the perennial stream network and incorporating it in finding clusters, identifying points of diversion, calculating distance to points of diversion and including this distance in the overall distance to nearest infrastructure, identifying land ownership by reach, and calculating distance to private land. Layers have also been made for all of the above.\r\n- BRAT Braid Handler: Using the stream name to identify main channels.\r\n- iHyd: Adding the hydrological equations as inputs, rather than directing users to edit the code.\r\n- Vegetation Capacity FIS: Extending the upper limit of the capacity model.\r\n- Combined Capacity FIS: Extending the upper limit of the capacity model.\r\n- Conservation Restoration: Incorporating the TNC strategies map as an optional output, renaming of categories for accuracy, and identifying any canals as \"major risk\".\r\n- Data Capture Validation: Adding drainage area threshold as optional input to limit snapping of dams far from the main channel, adding \"Snapped\" field to dams to identify which were used in the validation. Calculating and making layers comparing existing vs. historic capacity, comparing BRAT estimated vs. surveyed dam counts, and % of estimated capacity occupied by dams. Parsing the \"Easiest - Low-hanging fruit\" category into conservation and restoration categories based on the proportion of capacity occupied.\r\n- Layer Package Generator: Adding clipping network functionality, including all new layers, and modifying the ordering so dam density is always shown before dam count in the capacity layers.\r\n- Collect Summary Reports: Completely new. \r\n- BRAT toolbox: Descriptions added to user interface, default values for output names.\r\n- Batch scripts: Cleaned up versions of all batch scripts are provided in the Supporting Tools/Batch Scripts folder.\r\n\r\nLastly, we have improved the website documentation to reflect these changes and updated all in-code documentation as fit, including @tyler1218hatch making all BRAT scripts PEP8 compliant. \r\n\r\n@tyler1218hatch Am I missing anything?","html":"<h1>BRAT Version 3.1.00 is here!</h1>\n\n<p>@wally-mac @bangen @joewheaton  </p>\n\n<p>@tyler1218hatch and I have finally finished up doing a complete overhaul of BRAT and I just released the new version as 3.1.00.

I don't really see any area that peridot can try to tap into that Kahlan userbase in a way that Kahlan isn't already doing.\r\n\r\nThe describe-it syntax is very popular in other languages and personally, I do like how expressive the system can be. That being said however, PHPUnit by far is the defacto testing framework and majority of the PHP community resources and integrations revolve around PHPUnit. If kahlan hasn't taken off by now, then it's very likely that the php community won't be ready to rally around a new framework.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I actually like that the PHP community largely pools our resources into one testing framework. It's very attractive for new comers and also means that the community can focus our efforts on growing the PHPUnit ecosystem instead of dilluting our efforts among competing frameworks.\r\n\r\nAll that said, I do think there might a space for a new frontend for PHPUnit. A library that piggy backs off the entire phpunit framework but provides a different interface for writing tests with the describe-it syntax that the peridot/kahlan community enjoys.\r\n\r\nI think peridot 2.0 would be a good place to explore this integration with phpunit. It'd allow us to focus on the parts of testing framework that are interesting and leave the heavy lifting to phpunit all the while piggy backing off of the wealth of documentation and third party plugins that phpunit provides.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner, we'd probably make peridot/leo be just a thin wrapper around the PHPUnit assertions library and include in the peridot 2.0 core.\r\n\r\nIn the long run, I'd love to see peridot's new phpunit frontend be brought under the fold of PHPUnit with first class support and apart of the phpunit ecosystem instead of a separate library.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you all think about this idea, welcome to suggestions :)","meta":{"source":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/peridot-php/peridot/issues/214"}}

Ctrl+click on the import line to try to 'Follow Link'\r\nResult: it shows an error-message popup saying 'Unable to open' with the wrong path\r\n\r\n**extensions**\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes\r\n","meta":{"source":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/78894"}}
